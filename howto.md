### Installation

#### Quick Setup

The simplest way to install dusk is running the install script from the console on a Debian-based system. Using [Tails](https://tails.net/) with persistence on a USB or inside a virtual machine on any operating system is recommended for additional security, but not required.

```
curl -o- https://rundusk.org/install.sh | bash
```

You may be prompted for your password.

#### Virtualization

The dusk software is designed and tested to run on Debian under the GNOME desktop environment. Debian is a well-maintained and tested operating system and the GNOME desktop environment provides an excellent experience to users coming to Linux from macOS.

You can run Debian and Dusk inside the operating system of your choosing by using a virtual machine: this allows you to run dusk's environment without making changes to your operating system.

If this sounds scary or hard - don't worry! It's easier than it sounds. The next sections provide a detailed guide on how to get up and running in a virtual machine on Debian, macOS, or Windows.

There are many options for virtualization software for every platform, but this guide will show you how to use the ones that have the simplest feature set to get the job done and are free and open-source

#### Debian Users

First, download and install [GNOME Boxes](https://apps.gnome.org/Boxes/).

```
sudo apt install gnome-boxes
```

Once installed, open Boxes, click the **Plus +** icon and select Download OS.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-001.png)

Select "Debian Testing x86_64 (netinst)".

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-002.png)

Enter **dusk** for the name, ensure **Express Installation** is enabled, enter **dusk** for your username and set a password. Set *Memory* to at least **8.0GiB** and storage to whatever you like (you can change this later).

When you're finished, click **Create**. Wait for the download and installation to finish, it may take a bit.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-003.png)

Once complete, you should have a Debian 12 login screen. Enter the password you set during installation to login.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-004.png)

To install dusk, you'll need administrator privileges. Open the **Terminal** app by pressing the *Super Key* ("Windows" key or "Command" on macOS), typing "Terminal", and pressing enter or clicking the icon that appears.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-005.png)

In **Terminal**, type `su --login` and press **Enter**. Type your password and press Enter again. 

Add the dusk user to the administrator group, by typing `adduser dusk sudo` and pressing Enter. Now restart the virtual machine by clicking the **Power** icon in the top right of the menu bar and selecting **Restart**.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-006.png)

The virtual machine should restart and you'll be returned to the login screen. Log back in and open **Firefox**. Navigate to [rundusk.org](https://rundusk.org) and copy the install command from the homepage.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-007.png)
![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-008.png)

Open **Terminal** again (*Super Key* , then type "Terminal"). Install cURL, by typing `sudo apt install curl` and pressing *Enter*. Then, right click and paste the install command and press *Enter*.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-009.png)

When the installer is finished, press the *Super Key* and type **Files** or **dusk**. You should see two apps: **dusk:Files** and **dusk:Settings**. Click on **dusk:Files**.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-010.png)
![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-011.png)

Follow the initial setup prompts.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-012.png)
![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-013.png)
![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-014.png)
![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-015.png)

After dusk is finished, you'll be prompted a final time for the *password you set for dusk* in the previous steps. Enter it to open the **Files** view.

![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-016.png)
![debian vm install](assets/images/deb-0017.png)

Dusk is now installed and running. Use the virtual operating system to manage your sensitive material. Open **dusk:Settings** to link to other devices, create sneakernets, and more.

#### MacOS Users

* Download and install [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/).
* Download the [Debian Trixie ISO](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/trixie_di_alpha1/amd64/iso-cd/debian-trixie-DI-alpha1-amd64-netinst.iso)
* Create a VM in UTM using the Trixie .iso file you downloaded
* Once installed, the steps are the same as in the Debian section above


#### Windows Users

Windows users should expect a similar process as macOS, but using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), although Windows is not currently supported.

### Setup

#### Command Line Interface

Once you have installed dusk or linked it as a global package, open your Terminal and run `dusk --help`.

The CLI will print a list of options and what they do. This is where you'll find tools to interact with dusk. But first you have to start dusk for the first time! In that same Terminal just run `dusk`.

The CLI will prompt you to enter a password to protect the key it generated. Then, it will print a list of words and tell you to write them down. Do that and run `dusk` again.

Now dusk will start bootstrapping the Tor network connection and eventually it will say it's listening for connections. Now you'll want to connect to someone to discover more of the network. But how? There is no signaling server, no DNS seeds, or list of operating nodes (yet). So, here is where your IRL network comes into play.

Maybe it's your affinity group, your research team, your friends - they need to run dusk too. And you'll exchange "identity bundles" to bootstrap from each other. To do that, we need to ask our dusk node for it. In *another* Terminal, run `dusk --link`.

This is like your username. It contains information about how to communicate with your dusk node. Note that your link contains your onion address. Sharing it online could create a anonymity compromise. Share it with your network out of band. When you have exchanged links, run `dusk --rpc "connect <link>"`.

You need a minimum of 3 dusk nodes to form a functioning network. These could be friends, family, colleagues, members of your affinity group, etc. dusk can operate segmented to a small community or connected to a wider global network. 

Run your dusk node in the background with `dusk --daemon`. 

### Basics

The dusk CLI provides a number of tools for interacting with dusk and the network, but there are 2 primary operations to familiarize yourself with first: shred and retrace. 

#### `--shred`

**Shred** takes a file, encrypts it to your key, splits it up into equal segments, generates parity segments (for recovery from data loss), creates a metadata pointer, encrypts the metadata, and depending on your choice either: writes the pieces to a special folder called a `duskbundle`, stores the pieces in the network using the DHT, or transfers them across an array of USB drives (see [Sneakernets](#sneakernets).

To shred a file and store the pieces in the DHT using the control port:

```
dusk --shred --dht --control-port 5275
```

dusk will talk you through the process and keep you updated on progress.

#### `--retrace`

**Retrace** takes an encrypted metadata pointer, decrypts it then depending on your choice either: reads the pieces from a `duskbundle`, downloads the pieces from the network, or reads them from an array of USB drives. Then, retrace will reassmble the pieces, encode any corrupted or missing pieces, decrypt the original file, and save it.

To retrace the same file from the previous example from the DHT:

```
dusk --retrace --dht --control-port 5275
```

dusk will talk you through the process and keep you updated on progress.

### Advanced

The next most important feature is dusk's publish/subscribe system. Nodes can receive arbitrary publications announced through the network by adding the fingerprint of the publisher to their subscriptions. Whenever dusk is handed a PUBLISH message it is interested in, it can trigger a webhook to a onion address.

#### `--test-hooks`

If you are developing an application that uses the pub/sub system, your application will expose an onion service where dusk can send POST requests with the publication contents in the body. Your application can then validate and process those messages according to your needs.

You can test this out using the `--test-hooks` option - which will start a simple onion service that prints messages it receives from dusk to the console. *Do not use this AS IS in production.*

### Configuration

A dusk node requires a configuration file to get up and running. The path to this 
file is given to `dusk` when starting a node (or the defaults will be used).

```
dusk --config myconfig.ini
```

If a configuration file is not supplied, a minimal default configuration is 
automatically created and used, which will generate a private key, database, 
and other necessary files. All of this data will be created and stored in 
`$HOME/.config/dusk`, unless a `--datadir` option is supplied. Valid configuration 
files may be in either INI or JSON format.

#### DaemonPidFilePath

##### Default: `$HOME/.config/dusk/dusk.pid`

The location to write the PID file for the daemon.

#### PublicKeyPath

##### Default: `$HOME/.config/dusk/dusk.pub`

Path to public key key file.

#### PrivateKeyPath

##### Default: `$HOME/.config/dusk/dusk.key`

Path to private key key file to use for identity.

#### EmbeddedDatabaseDirectory

##### Default: `$HOME/.config/dusk/dusk.dht`

Sets the directory to store DHT entries.

#### NodeListenPort

##### Default: `5274`

Sets the local port to bind the node's RPC service.

#### NodeListenAddress

##### Default: `0.0.0.0`

Sets the address to bind the RPC service.

#### VerboseLoggingEnabled

##### Default: `1`

More detailed logging of messages sent and received. Useful for debugging.

#### LogFilePath

##### Default: `$HEAD/.config/dusk.log`

Path to write the daemon's log file. Log file will rotate either every 24 hours 
or when it exceeds 10MB, whichever happens first.

#### LogFileMaxBackCopies

##### Default: `3`

Maximum number of rotated log files to keep.

#### NetworkBootstrapNodes[]

##### Default: `(empty)`

Add a map of network bootstrap nodes to this section to use for discovering 
other peers. Default configuration should come with a list of known and 
trusted contacts.

#### OnionVirtualPort

##### Default: `443`

The virtual port to use for the hidden service.

#### OnionHiddenServiceDirectory

##### Default: `$HOME/.config/dusk/hidden_service`

The directory to store hidden service keys and other information required by 
the Tor process.

#### OnionLoggingEnabled

##### Default: `0`

Redirects the Tor process log output through dusk's logger for the purpose of 
debugging.

#### OnionLoggingVerbosity

##### Default: `notice`

Defines the verbosity level of the Tor process logging. Valid options are: 
`debug`, `info`, `notice`.

#### ControlPortEnabled

##### Default: `0`

Enables the {@link Control} interface over a TCP socket.

#### ControlPort

##### Default: `5275`

The TCP port to for the control interface to listen on.

#### ControlSockEnabled

##### Default: `1`

Enables the {@link Control} interface over a UNIX domain socket.

#### ControlSock

##### Default: `$HOME/.config/dusk/dusk.sock`

The path to the file to use for the control interface.

#### TestNetworkEnabled

##### Default: `0`

Places dusk into test mode, significantly lowering the identity solution
difficulty and the permission solution difficulty.

### Sneakernets

"Sneakernet" is an informal term that refers to transferring data between parties using physical media, like a USB drive, instead of networks. In scenarios where bandwidth is limited, internet access is unavailable, or in cases where the threat model warrants that some data not be transmitted over the internet, sneakernets offer security. They do this in the form of a greatly reduced attack surface, because unauthorized access to data over a sneakernet requires physical access to the media it is stored on.

dusk is built with sneakernets as a transmission model in mind. A subset of the shred/retrace protocol is implemented to function without network access - instead using an array of USB drives. This is called dusk/SHOES (dusk over shoes). SHOES is an acronym for Simple Human Operated Encrypted Sneakernet.

#### dusk/SHOES

> This feature is experimental.

The dusk CLI includes a `--shoes` option that can be used in 3 ways:

* `dusk --shoes` will setup a new dusk/SHOES USB
* `dusk --shred --shoes` will encrypt/shred/encode/distribute a file to `n` USB drives
* `dusk --retrace --shoes` will retrace a file from `n` USB drives, then decrypt and save

Setting up a dusk/SHOES USB functions a lot like setting up dusk on first run. All of the configuration, identity keys, and data directories are created on the USB. The dusk/SHOES USB can even be used to run dusk online later.
Shredding a file follows a guided prompt. Retracing follows a similar process.
